Heart Disease Prediction: Analysis and Model Performance Report
________________________________________
1. Objective
The goal of this analysis is to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient features using machine learning models. Three algorithms were evaluated: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to compare model performances.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key Findings:
1.	Feature Distributions:
o	Features like age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate showed varied distributions across patients.
o	Some features had slight skewness, which was addressed during preprocessing.
2.	Correlations:
o	A heatmap revealed strong correlations among certain features, such as age and maximum heart rate with the target variable.
o	Multicollinearity was minimal, ensuring robust model performance.
3.	Data Visualizations:
o	Histograms displayed feature distributions.
o	Scatter plots identified potential separability in features.
o	Heatmaps highlighted correlations between features and the target.
